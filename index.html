  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>
      I am a creative individual focused on cinematic visuals, storytelling,
      and emotional impact. My work revolves around creating atmosphere,
      mood, and meaning rather than just visuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Videography is my strongest field. I approach video as a narrative medium,
      paying close attention to pacing, movement, light, and composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Photography supports my visual language. I work with intention, framing,
      and lighting to capture moments that feel alive and expressive.

  <!-- CREATIVE IDENTITY -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>CREATIVE IDENTITY</h2>
    <p>
      My creative identity is built around minimalism, contrast, and cinematic
      aesthetics. I prefer clean visuals, controlled color palettes, and subtle
      motion that enhances the experience instead of distracting from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m inspired by films, visual storytelling, silence, shadows, and carefully
      crafted frames. Every element should have a reason to exist.

    <h2>CURRENT FOCUS</h2>
